# Module

If you would prefer to use a module instead of a function follow these steps:

1. Copy the file from the [module.js](module.js) and paste it into a new Scriptable script 
2. Rename the script to `Scriptable-HTML-Widget`
3. Create a new script and paste `const htmlWidget = importModule("Scriptable-HTML-Widget")` at the top of the file
4. Start to create the widget as you would normally
